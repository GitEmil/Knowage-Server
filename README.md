## Welcome to Knowage

Knowage is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional sources and big data systems. Knowage is the new brand for SpagoBI project: this new brand marks the value of the well-known open source business intelligence suite after significant functional and technological transformations and a new offering model. 
The suite is composed of several modules, each one conceived for a specific analytical domain. They can be used individually as complete solution for a certain task, or combined with one another to ensure full coverage of userâ€™ requirements. 

The sub-products of the suite are:
* BD (big data), to analyse data stored on big data clusters or NoSQL databases
* SI (smart intelligence), the usual business intelligence on structured data, but more oriented to self-service capabilities and agile prototyping
* ER (enterprise reporting), to produce and distribute static reports
* LI (location intelligence), to relate business data with spatial or geographical information
* PM (performance management), to manage KPIs and organize scorecards
* PA (predictive analysis), for more advanced analyses

Knowage supports a modern vision of the data analytics, providing new self-service capabilities that give autonomy to the end-user, now able to build his own analysis and explore his own data space, also combining data that come from different sources. 

Knowage is available on two versions:
* the community edition, with the whole set of analytical capabilities, it is part of the software stack managed by [OW2](https://www.ow2.org/) and the reference implementation of the Data Visualization GE in [FIWARE](https://www.fiware.org/) (see the [FIWARE catalogue entry](https://catalogue.fiware.org/enablers/data-visualization-knowage) for details), as SpagoBI was;
* the enterprise edition, provided and guaranteed directly from Engineering Group - the leading Italian software and services company - with a commercial offering and some facilities for the administrator.
